### <div align=center> About the project:
<div align=center>
  You probably had one in your hands in your younger days or maybe you have seen something like this. It might function a little bit different than original toy but it keeps the same feeling when playing with it. Etch-a-sketch is a toy where you can draw whatever you want in up to 64x64 grid, using whatever color you will chose from color picker. You might also chose Rainbow! mode which will randomly change colors when drawing. Pretty simple design but works well. Happy drawing!
